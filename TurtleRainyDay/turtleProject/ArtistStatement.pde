  As a student with a background in computer science, I have not had that many opportunities to 
express a creative side to programming. Not many courses I have previously taken offer students 
to develop creative assignments or projects. Most projects I have worked on deal with algorithms 
or technical programming that may or may not leave me crying in the middle of working on it. 
Usually in the past if I were to put together creative projects I would make video games that 
focus on the mechanics of the game and not much of the visual art. Although, I can now attempt 
a visually artistic approach with my programming skills. My current project, “Turtle’s Rainy Day” 
has let me experiment with a creative challenge of combining visual art and programming code. My 
overall vision for the art project was to make a scenic image with animations. I have rarely made 
artistic images in the past and wanted to try a style that is different than what I am used to making.
For this current project though, I am able to have a focal point on the visual art side. 

  My motivation for creating this specific scene comes from my personal interests. The first component 
that I surrounded the artpiece around was a turtle. Turtles are my favourite animal, so I wanted to 
incorporate it within the piece. Afterwards, I decided to create an environment for the turtle to live 
in. Half of the canvas was turned into a land area that the turtle is chilling on, and the other half 
is a pond that I imagined the turtle would spend its days around. Once the basic environment was settled 
on, I needed a way to animate the artpiece. I decided to implement a weather element to make use of animation. 
The weather I ended up applying was cloudy and rainy. I also really like rainy weather, so it felt fitting
to combine it with my turtle concept. A tree was also added to the landscape so that the turtle can hide 
from the rainfall.

  The images created are in a cartoonish style rather than realistic. I wanted to have a simplistic and 
somewhat cute appearance. It definitely had nothing to do with my limited artistic ability whatsoever.
Majority of the images are developed solely with geometric primitives, such as ellipses, polygons, and lines. 
Each primitive has a purpose to represent an image’s features. Ellipses are used for rounded edges, specifically 
for the clouds and tree leaves shapes. Polygons in the use of PShapes are used for creating the grass landscape 
and pond area. The raindrops are short thin lines that increase their y-axis position to simulate raindrops 
falling down from the sky. The only visual component that was not specifically made by myself was the turtle.
A turtle image was imported to the project. An animation was also applied to the turtle to make the turtle look
up towards the sky and then downwards. Almost simulating a movement of the turtle watching the raindrops fall 
down. Also, the atmosphere of the piece is meant to be calming and relaxing. The light rain and overall darker
colour scheme implements a chilling and cooling mood. Non-bright colours were used to emphasize the weather. 
It almost looks as though the temperature would be colder or chilly as there is no source of sunlight and warmth 
due to the darker colours used. To add to the atmosphere, a rain background sound effect was included. The rain’s 
pitter-patter in a nature scene produces a calming effect. 

  The animations that I implemented are intended to imitate effects that would happen in real life. My plan for 
the rain effects was to have the raindrops fall from the clouds, and will cause a certain animationto trigger 
depending on if the raindrop hits the pond or grass. There are ripples formed when a raindrop falls into the pond
and there are splashes when they fall onto the grass area. To display the ripples, three ellipses are set at different 
sizes and will increase until a certain maximum size, which they will then disappear one by one. Splashes are created
with angled lines where the raindrop falls. Randomness and collision detection are big factors for carrying out these
methods. I set random landing points for each raindrop, and when a raindrop reaches that exact point on the pond or 
grass its associated effect will be called into action. 

  Building a project with creative artistic intent as the main goal was a bit difficult but also very fun. As I have
not had much experience with animation before, it was interesting to develop code with that concept in mind. My 
project’s end result encapsulates a cartoon-like natural scenery. An atmosphere of calming nature lets the viewer 
see the piece as almost relaxing and peaceful. Those feelings are also provoked by the continuous and steady sounds
of the rain falling. The piece overall produces a scenic view of a lonely turtle’s rainy day as it patiently waits 
for the rain to end, while sitting under the cover of a tree.
